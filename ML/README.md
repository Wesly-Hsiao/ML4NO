# Data
Store on gpu 140.114.94.240
* n1000000_0716.npz -- gaussian on theta12, theta13, theta23, and sdm, deltacp half on 0 and 180  
* n1000000_0728.npz -- flat on theta12, theta13, sdm, theta23 half on 45 and else flat, deltacp half on 0 and 180
* n1000000_0803.npz -- fixed theta12 and sdm, flat on theta13, theta23 half on 45 and else flat, deltacp half on 0 and 180 (the preferred dataset for classification)
* n1000000_0804_all_flat.npz -- fixed theta12 and sdm, flat on theta13, theta23, delta (the preferred dataset for regression)

* NuFit_IO.npz -- the spectrum created by NuFit inverse ordering parameters
* NuFit_NO.npz -- the spectrum created by NuFit normal ordering parameters

# Features files
A python notebook to inspect the features of the input data.
* The name of the features
* The histogram of the feature
* The correlation matrix of the ve_dune
